# Kundli Matching Project â€“ Technical Documentation

## 1. What is `launch.html` Doing?

`launch.html` is a **project launcher page** for the Kundli Matching web application. Its main purposes are:

- **Landing Page:** Welcomes users and introduces the project.
- **Navigation Hub:** Provides buttons to:
  - **Launch Main Application** (`index.html`)
  - **Algorithm Testing Suite** (`test-validation.html`)
- **Quick Start Guide:** Step-by-step instructions for new users.
- **Feature List:** Highlights key features (Ashtakoot analysis, dosha detection, etc.).
- **Algorithm Validation:** Communicates accuracy and validation status.
- **Disclaimer:** Reminds users the tool is for informational purposes only.

**Summary:**
`launch.html` is a static, styled HTML page that acts as a gateway and informational dashboard for the Kundli Matching project.

## 2. Technology Used

### **Frontend:**

- **HTML5:** Structure of all pages.
- **CSS3:** Styling via embedded and external stylesheets (`styles.css`).
- **JavaScript:** Application logic in `app.js`, `app-minimal.js`, and `kundli-engine.js`.
- **No Frameworks:** Uses vanilla JavaScript and CSS (no React, Angular, etc.).

### **Backend:**

- **None (Static Site):** All logic is client-side in the browser.

### **Other:**

- **Responsive Design:** CSS media queries for mobile support.
- **No Build Tools:** No Webpack, Babel, or npm/yarn.

## 3. How the Website Works

### **Site Structure:**

- **Entry Point:** Users start at `launch.html`.
- **Main Application:** `index.html` is the primary Kundli Matching interface.
- **Testing Suite:** `test-validation.html` for algorithm validation.

### **Main Application Flow:**

1. **User Input:** Users enter birth details for groom and bride.
2. **Client-Side Processing:** JavaScript processes the input on button click.
3. **Astrological Calculations:** `kundli-engine.js` computes Ashtakoot Guna Milan, dosha detection, and scores.
4. **Results Display:** Results and recommendations are rendered dynamically in the browser.
5. **Styling:** All UI is styled with CSS, supporting light/dark modes and responsive layouts.

### **Testing and Validation:**

- **Test Pages:** Files like `test-validation.html` and `test-styled-results.html` are used for validation.

### **No Server-Side Processing:**

- All data stays in the browser; no server or database is used.
